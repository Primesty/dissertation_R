# Dissertation analyses

This repo contains all my .R files for data analysis, including some .Rmd files with markdowns where I kept track of the individual
steps in terms of

1) Data acquistion
2) Data munging/cleaning
3) Exploratory data analysis

etc. It also contains all the scripts for text processing and tweet-cleaning to remove RTs, @-mentions, urls, emojis, etc.
