# Dissertation analyses

This repo contains all my .R files for data analysis, including some .Rmd files with markdowns, where I kept track of the individual
steps in terms of

1) Data acquisition
2) Data munging/cleaning
3) Exploratory data analysis
4) Model building and validation

The repository also contains an **R-Package** I wrote, containing all my analysis functions. I did this mainly for fun and practice:)

It also contains all the scripts for text processing and tweet-cleaning to remove RTs, @-mentions, urls, emojis, etc.
